cyton_gamma_1500
================

URDF description for the Robai Cyton Gamma 1500 robot manipulator.

The model doesn't work in Gazebo (works perfectly in RViz) at the moment. This is most probably due to the incompatible mesh format for Gazebo - the DAE mesh polygons have to be formatted differently. If you have a fix, let me know.


Special thanks to Giorgio Toscana for providing the model extraction script!
